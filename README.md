# Learning Most JS

[MOST API](https://github.com/cujojs/most/blob/master/docs/api.md#mostfromevent)

## 1

Simple example taken from the API docs.
This is a completely synchronous examples

## 2 

Tried an async example which failed.
There is an example in the most documentation but this is not really async.

## 3

Investigated the Kafka Stream code and found they use EventEvent to join Kafka to Most api.
This is an example which demonstrates this.
